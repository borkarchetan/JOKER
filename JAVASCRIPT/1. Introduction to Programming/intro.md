# "Introduction to Programming."

**1.1 What is Programming?**
   - Programming is the process of giving instructions to a computer to perform tasks. These instructions are written in a programming language like JavaScript.

**1.2 Basic Concepts:**
   - **Variables:** Containers to store data. They have names and can hold different types of values, such as numbers, strings, and objects.
   - **Data Types:** Different kinds of values, like strings (text), numbers (integers and decimals), booleans (true or false), arrays (ordered lists), and objects (collections of key-value pairs).
   - **Operators:** Symbols used to perform operations on variables and values. Examples include + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), and === (equality).
   - **Control Structures:** Instructions that determine the flow of a program, including if statements (conditional execution) and loops (repeated execution).

## 1.3 Basic Programming Concepts:

**1.3.1 Variables and Data Types:**
```javascript
// Declare a variable
let name = "John";

// Different data types
let age = 30;                  // Number
let isStudent = true;          // Boolean
let hobbies = ["reading", "coding"]; // Array
let person = {                // Object
    firstName: "Jane",
    lastName: "Doe"
};
```

**1.3.2 Operators:**
```javascript
let num1 = 10;
let num2 = 5;

let sum = num1 + num2;       // Addition
let difference = num1 - num2; // Subtraction
let product = num1 * num2;    // Multiplication
let quotient = num1 / num2;   // Division

let isEqual = num1 === num2; // Equality check
```

**1.3.3 Control Structures:**
```javascript
let age = 18;

if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("You're an adult.");
} else {
    console.log("You're a minor.");
}

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}

let colors = ["red", "blue", "green"];
for (let color of colors) {
    console.log(color);
}
```

## 1.4 Functions:
Functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help in organizing and reusing code.

```javascript
function greet(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet("Alice"); // Output: Hello, Alice!
```

## 1.5 Resources for Learning:
- Websites: Codecademy, freeCodeCamp, MDN Web Docs (JavaScript section)
- Books: "Eloquent JavaScript" by Marijn Haverbeke, "JavaScript: The Good Parts" by Douglas Crockford

## 1.6 Practice:
1. Write a program that calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width.
2. Create a function that checks if a given number is even or odd.
3. Use a loop to print the first 10 even numbers.

Remember, practice is key to grasping these concepts. Take your time, experiment with code, and gradually build your understanding. As you become comfortable with these fundamental concepts, you'll be well-prepared to move on to more advanced topics in JavaScript.
