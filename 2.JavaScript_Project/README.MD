_Starting with basic JavaScript is a great foundation for learning React. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and it's widely used in web development. Here's a list of beginner-friendly projects you can work on to learn React from scratch:_

## 1. [**To-Do List App**:](https://set-work.netlify.app/)
   - Create a simple to-do list application where users can add, delete, and mark tasks as complete.
   - Focus on managing the application's state and updating the UI based on user interactions.

## 2. [**Counter App**:]()
   - Build a basic counter application that allows users to increment and decrement a number.
   - Learn how to manage state and handle events in React.

## 3. [**Weather App**:]()
   - Develop a weather app that fetches data from a weather API and displays current weather conditions based on user input (e.g., city name).
   - Practice making API requests and rendering data in React components.

## 4. [**Blog or News Feed**:]()
   - Create a blog or news feed application that displays a list of articles with titles and summaries.
   - Learn about mapping through arrays of data and rendering dynamic content.

## 5. [**Simple Calculator**:]()
   - Build a basic calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
   - Practice handling user input and performing calculations.

## 6. [**GitHub User Search**:]()

_For each of these projects, start by setting up your development environment, including Node.js and a code editor like Visual Studio Code. Then, gradually introduce React concepts such as components, state, props, and event handling as you work on these projects. You can find plenty of online tutorials and documentation to guide you through building these applications step by step. As you become more comfortable with React, you can gradually tackle more complex projects and deepen your understanding of this powerful library._
