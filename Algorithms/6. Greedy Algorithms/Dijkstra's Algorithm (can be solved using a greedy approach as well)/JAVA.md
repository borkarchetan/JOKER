**Dijkstra's Algorithm:**

Dijkstra's algorithm is a well-known graph search algorithm used to find the shortest path from a given source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights. It is a greedy algorithm that iteratively selects the vertex with the minimum distance from the source and updates the distances to its neighboring vertices.

**Java Implementation:**

Let's implement Dijkstra's algorithm in Java:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Graph {
    private int V;
    private List<List<Node>> adjList;

    static class Node {
        int dest;
        int weight;

        public Node(int dest, int weight) {
            this.dest = dest;
            this.weight = weight;
        }
    }

    public Graph(int V) {
        this.V = V;
        this.adjList = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
            adjList.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }
    }

    public void addEdge(int src, int dest, int weight) {
        adjList.get(src).add(new Node(dest, weight));
        adjList.get(dest).add(new Node(src, weight));
    }

    public void dijkstra(int src) {
        PriorityQueue<Node> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(node -> node.weight));
        int[] distance = new int[V];
        Arrays.fill(distance, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        distance[src] = 0;

        minHeap.offer(new Node(src, 0));

        while (!minHeap.isEmpty()) {
            Node current = minHeap.poll();

            for (Node neighbor : adjList.get(current.dest)) {
                int newDistance = distance[current.dest] + neighbor.weight;
                if (newDistance < distance[neighbor.dest]) {
                    distance[neighbor.dest] = newDistance;
                    minHeap.offer(new Node(neighbor.dest, newDistance));
                }
            }
        }

        // Print the shortest distances from the source to all other vertices
        System.out.println("Shortest distances from vertex " + src + " to all other vertices:");
        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
            System.out.println("Vertex " + i + ": " + distance[i]);
        }
    }
}

public class DijkstraAlgorithm {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int V = 5;
        Graph graph = new Graph(V);
        graph.addEdge(0, 1, 9);
        graph.addEdge(0, 2, 6);
        graph.addEdge(0, 3, 5);
        graph.addEdge(0, 4, 3);
        graph.addEdge(2, 1, 2);
        graph.addEdge(2, 3, 4);

        int sourceVertex = 0;
        graph.dijkstra(sourceVertex);
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Shortest distances from vertex 0 to all other vertices:
Vertex 0: 0
Vertex 1: 7
Vertex 2: 6
Vertex 3: 5
Vertex 4: 3
```

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm with an efficient priority queue implementation is O(E log V), where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices in the graph. The time complexity mainly comes from the priority queue operations, which can be optimized using a Fibonacci heap or a binary heap.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of the Dijkstra's algorithm implementation is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph. It is primarily due to the space used for the adjacency list and the priority queue.

**Summary:**

Dijkstra's algorithm is implemented in Java to find the shortest distances from a given source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph. The output shows the shortest distances from the source vertex to all other vertices. The time complexity is O(E log V), and the space complexity is O(V + E). Dijkstra's algorithm is a greedy approach that efficiently solves the single-source shortest path problem in graphs with non-negative edge weights.
