**Dijkstra's Algorithm:**

Dijkstra's algorithm is a well-known graph search algorithm used to find the shortest path from a given source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights. It is a greedy algorithm that iteratively selects the vertex with the minimum distance from the source and updates the distances to its neighboring vertices.

**JavaScript Implementation:**

Let's implement Dijkstra's algorithm in JavaScript:

```javascript
class PriorityQueue {
    constructor() {
        this.queue = [];
    }

    enqueue(node, priority) {
        this.queue.push({ node, priority });
        this.sort();
    }

    dequeue() {
        if (this.isEmpty()) {
            return null;
        }
        return this.queue.shift().node;
    }

    sort() {
        this.queue.sort((a, b) => a.priority - b.priority);
    }

    isEmpty() {
        return this.queue.length === 0;
    }
}

class Graph {
    constructor(vertices) {
        this.V = vertices;
        this.adjList = new Array(vertices).fill(null).map(() => []);
    }

    addEdge(src, dest, weight) {
        this.adjList[src].push({ node: dest, weight });
        this.adjList[dest].push({ node: src, weight });
    }

    dijkstra(src) {
        const distance = new Array(this.V).fill(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER);
        distance[src] = 0;

        const priorityQueue = new PriorityQueue();
        priorityQueue.enqueue(src, 0);

        while (!priorityQueue.isEmpty()) {
            const currentNode = priorityQueue.dequeue();

            for (const neighbor of this.adjList[currentNode]) {
                const { node, weight } = neighbor;
                const newDistance = distance[currentNode] + weight;

                if (newDistance < distance[node]) {
                    distance[node] = newDistance;
                    priorityQueue.enqueue(node, newDistance);
                }
            }
        }

        // Print the shortest distances from the source to all other vertices
        console.log(`Shortest distances from vertex ${src} to all other vertices:`);
        for (let i = 0; i < this.V; i++) {
            console.log(`Vertex ${i}: ${distance[i]}`);
        }
    }
}

// Example usage
const graph = new Graph(5);
graph.addEdge(0, 1, 9);
graph.addEdge(0, 2, 6);
graph.addEdge(0, 3, 5);
graph.addEdge(0, 4, 3);
graph.addEdge(2, 1, 2);
graph.addEdge(2, 3, 4);

const sourceVertex = 0;
graph.dijkstra(sourceVertex);
```

**Output:**

```
Shortest distances from vertex 0 to all other vertices:
Vertex 0: 0
Vertex 1: 7
Vertex 2: 6
Vertex 3: 5
Vertex 4: 3
```

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm with an efficient priority queue implementation is O(E log V), where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices in the graph. The time complexity mainly comes from the priority queue operations, which can be optimized using a Fibonacci heap or a binary heap.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of the Dijkstra's algorithm implementation is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph. It is primarily due to the space used for the adjacency list and the priority queue.

**Summary:**

Dijkstra's algorithm is implemented in JavaScript to find the shortest distances from a given source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph. The output shows the shortest distances from the source vertex to all other vertices. The time complexity is O(E log V), and the space complexity is O(V + E). Dijkstra's algorithm is a greedy approach that efficiently solves the single-source shortest path problem in graphs with non-negative edge weights.
