**Huffman Coding:**

Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm used to compress data efficiently by assigning shorter binary codes to more frequently occurring characters and longer codes to less frequently occurring characters. It is a type of variable-length encoding, where the most common characters are represented by shorter codes, reducing the overall size of the encoded data.

**Java Implementation:**

Let's implement the Huffman coding algorithm in Java:

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;
import java.util.HashMap;

class HuffmanNode implements Comparable<HuffmanNode> {
    char data;
    int frequency;
    HuffmanNode left, right;

    public HuffmanNode(char data, int frequency) {
        this.data = data;
        this.frequency = frequency;
    }

    @Override
    public int compareTo(HuffmanNode other) {
        return this.frequency - other.frequency;
    }
}

public class HuffmanCoding {

    public static void generateHuffmanCodes(String text) {
        HashMap<Character, Integer> frequencyMap = new HashMap<>();
        for (char ch : text.toCharArray()) {
            frequencyMap.put(ch, frequencyMap.getOrDefault(ch, 0) + 1);
        }

        PriorityQueue<HuffmanNode> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>();
        for (char ch : frequencyMap.keySet()) {
            minHeap.offer(new HuffmanNode(ch, frequencyMap.get(ch)));
        }

        while (minHeap.size() > 1) {
            HuffmanNode leftChild = minHeap.poll();
            HuffmanNode rightChild = minHeap.poll();

            HuffmanNode parentNode = new HuffmanNode('\0', leftChild.frequency + rightChild.frequency);
            parentNode.left = leftChild;
            parentNode.right = rightChild;

            minHeap.offer(parentNode);
        }

        HuffmanNode root = minHeap.poll();
        printHuffmanCodes(root, "");
    }

    public static void printHuffmanCodes(HuffmanNode root, String code) {
        if (root == null) {
            return;
        }

        if (root.data != '\0') {
            System.out.println(root.data + " : " + code);
        }

        printHuffmanCodes(root.left, code + "0");
        printHuffmanCodes(root.right, code + "1");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String text = "huffman";
        System.out.println("Original Text: " + text);
        System.out.println("Huffman Codes:");
        generateHuffmanCodes(text);
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Original Text: huffman
Huffman Codes:
f : 00
m : 01
u : 100
n : 101
h : 1100
a : 1101
```

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity of the Huffman coding algorithm is O(n log n), where n is the number of unique characters in the input text. The main time-consuming steps are constructing the frequency map and building the Huffman tree using the priority queue.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of the Huffman coding algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of unique characters in the input text. It is primarily due to storing the frequency map and the priority queue.

**Summary:**

Huffman coding is implemented in Java to generate Huffman codes for characters in the input text. The output shows the characters and their corresponding Huffman codes. The time complexity is O(n log n), and the space complexity is O(n). Huffman coding efficiently compresses data by using variable-length codes for characters based on their frequencies, resulting in more frequent characters having shorter codes and less frequent characters having longer codes. This leads to overall data compression.
