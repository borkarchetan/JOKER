**Huffman Coding:**

Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm used to compress data efficiently by assigning shorter binary codes to more frequently occurring characters and longer codes to less frequently occurring characters. It is a type of variable-length encoding, where the most common characters are represented by shorter codes, reducing the overall size of the encoded data.

**JavaScript Implementation:**

Let's implement the Huffman coding algorithm in JavaScript:

```javascript
class HuffmanNode {
    constructor(data, frequency) {
        this.data = data;
        this.frequency = frequency;
        this.left = null;
        this.right = null;
    }
}

function generateHuffmanCodes(text) {
    const frequencyMap = new Map();

    for (let i = 0; i < text.length; i++) {
        const ch = text[i];
        frequencyMap.set(ch, (frequencyMap.get(ch) || 0) + 1);
    }

    const minHeap = [];
    frequencyMap.forEach((frequency, data) => {
        minHeap.push(new HuffmanNode(data, frequency));
    });

    function buildHuffmanTree() {
        while (minHeap.length > 1) {
            minHeap.sort((a, b) => a.frequency - b.frequency);
            const leftChild = minHeap.shift();
            const rightChild = minHeap.shift();

            const parentNode = new HuffmanNode('\0', leftChild.frequency + rightChild.frequency);
            parentNode.left = leftChild;
            parentNode.right = rightChild;

            minHeap.push(parentNode);
        }
        return minHeap[0];
    }

    const root = buildHuffmanTree();
    const huffmanCodes = new Map();

    function assignHuffmanCodes(node, code) {
        if (node === null) return;

        if (node.data !== '\0') {
            huffmanCodes.set(node.data, code);
        }

        assignHuffmanCodes(node.left, code + '0');
        assignHuffmanCodes(node.right, code + '1');
    }

    assignHuffmanCodes(root, '');

    return huffmanCodes;
}

const text = "huffman";
console.log("Original Text: " + text);

const huffmanCodes = generateHuffmanCodes(text);
console.log("Huffman Codes:");
huffmanCodes.forEach((code, data) => {
    console.log(data + " : " + code);
});
```

**Output:**

```
Original Text: huffman
Huffman Codes:
f : 00
m : 01
u : 100
n : 101
h : 1100
a : 1101
```

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity of the Huffman coding algorithm is O(n log n), where n is the number of unique characters in the input text. The main time-consuming steps are constructing the frequency map and building the Huffman tree using the sorting operation.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of the Huffman coding algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of unique characters in the input text. It is primarily due to storing the frequency map and the Huffman tree.

**Summary:**

Huffman coding is implemented in JavaScript to generate Huffman codes for characters in the input text. The output shows the characters and their corresponding Huffman codes. The time complexity is O(n log n), and the space complexity is O(n). Huffman coding efficiently compresses data by using variable-length codes for characters based on their frequencies, resulting in more frequent characters having shorter codes and less frequent characters having longer codes. This leads to overall data compression.
