Let's explore Tree Traversal (In-order, Pre-order, Post-order) algorithms, their Java implementations, output, time complexity, space complexity, and a summary.

**Tree Traversal (In-order, Pre-order, Post-order):**

Tree Traversal is a process of visiting all the nodes of a tree data structure in a specific order. There are three common types of tree traversal:

1. In-order Traversal: Visits the left subtree, then the root node, and finally the right subtree.
2. Pre-order Traversal: Visits the root node, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.
3. Post-order Traversal: Visits the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the root node.

**Java Implementation:**

Let's consider a simple binary tree node class and implement the three types of tree traversal recursively:

```java
class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;

    public TreeNode(int val) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = null;
        this.right = null;
    }
}

public class TreeTraversal {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TreeNode root = new TreeNode(1);
        root.left = new TreeNode(2);
        root.right = new TreeNode(3);
        root.left.left = new TreeNode(4);
        root.left.right = new TreeNode(5);

        System.out.println("In-order Traversal:");
        inOrderTraversal(root);

        System.out.println("\nPre-order Traversal:");
        preOrderTraversal(root);

        System.out.println("\nPost-order Traversal:");
        postOrderTraversal(root);
    }

    public static void inOrderTraversal(TreeNode root) {
        if (root != null) {
            inOrderTraversal(root.left);
            System.out.print(root.val + " ");
            inOrderTraversal(root.right);
        }
    }

    public static void preOrderTraversal(TreeNode root) {
        if (root != null) {
            System.out.print(root.val + " ");
            preOrderTraversal(root.left);
            preOrderTraversal(root.right);
        }
    }

    public static void postOrderTraversal(TreeNode root) {
        if (root != null) {
            postOrderTraversal(root.left);
            postOrderTraversal(root.right);
            System.out.print(root.val + " ");
        }
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
In-order Traversal:
4 2 5 1 3 
Pre-order Traversal:
1 2 4 5 3 
Post-order Traversal:
4 5 2 3 1 
```

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity for all three types of tree traversal (in-order, pre-order, and post-order) is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because each node is visited exactly once in the process.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity for all three types of tree traversal is O(h), where h is the height of the tree. In the worst case, the height of the binary tree can be equal to the number of nodes (h = n) in a skewed tree. However, in a balanced binary tree, the height is log(n) (where n is the number of nodes), resulting in a space complexity of O(log n).

**Summary:**

Tree Traversal (In-order, Pre-order, Post-order) algorithms are used to visit all the nodes of a tree data structure in a specific order. The Java implementation shows recursive implementations of in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals for a simple binary tree. All three types of tree traversal have a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(h), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, and h is the height of the tree. These tree traversal algorithms are fundamental in tree-related algorithms and are used in various applications such as searching, inserting, and deleting nodes in a binary tree.
