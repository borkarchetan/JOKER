Let's explore Tree Traversal (In-order, Pre-order, Post-order) algorithms, their JavaScript implementations, output, time complexity, space complexity, and a summary.

**Tree Traversal (In-order, Pre-order, Post-order):**

Tree Traversal is a process of visiting all the nodes of a tree data structure in a specific order. There are three common types of tree traversal:

1. In-order Traversal: Visits the left subtree, then the root node, and finally the right subtree.
2. Pre-order Traversal: Visits the root node, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.
3. Post-order Traversal: Visits the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the root node.

**JavaScript Implementation:**

Let's consider a simple binary tree node class and implement the three types of tree traversal recursively:

```javascript
class TreeNode {
    constructor(val) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = null;
        this.right = null;
    }
}

function inOrderTraversal(root) {
    if (root !== null) {
        inOrderTraversal(root.left);
        console.log(root.val);
        inOrderTraversal(root.right);
    }
}

function preOrderTraversal(root) {
    if (root !== null) {
        console.log(root.val);
        preOrderTraversal(root.left);
        preOrderTraversal(root.right);
    }
}

function postOrderTraversal(root) {
    if (root !== null) {
        postOrderTraversal(root.left);
        postOrderTraversal(root.right);
        console.log(root.val);
    }
}

// Test the tree traversal algorithms
const root = new TreeNode(1);
root.left = new TreeNode(2);
root.right = new TreeNode(3);
root.left.left = new TreeNode(4);
root.left.right = new TreeNode(5);

console.log("In-order Traversal:");
inOrderTraversal(root);

console.log("\nPre-order Traversal:");
preOrderTraversal(root);

console.log("\nPost-order Traversal:");
postOrderTraversal(root);
```

**Output:**
```
In-order Traversal:
4
2
5
1
3

Pre-order Traversal:
1
2
4
5
3

Post-order Traversal:
4
5
2
3
1
```

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity for all three types of tree traversal (in-order, pre-order, and post-order) is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because each node is visited exactly once during the traversal process.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity for all three types of tree traversal is O(h), where h is the height of the tree. In the worst case, the height of the binary tree can be equal to the number of nodes (h = n) in a skewed tree. However, in a balanced binary tree, the height is log(n) (where n is the number of nodes), resulting in a space complexity of O(log n).

**Summary:**

Tree Traversal (In-order, Pre-order, Post-order) algorithms are used to visit all the nodes of a tree data structure in a specific order. The JavaScript implementation shows recursive implementations of in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals for a simple binary tree. All three types of tree traversal have a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(h), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, and h is the height of the tree. These tree traversal algorithms are fundamental in tree-related algorithms and are used in various applications such as searching, inserting, and deleting nodes in a binary tree.
