Sure! Let's simplify the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm's JavaScript implementation and provide a summary of it.

Depth-First Search (DFS) - JavaScript Implementation:

```javascript
class Graph {
    constructor() {
        this.adjList = new Map();
    }

    addVertex(vertex) {
        if (!this.adjList.has(vertex)) {
            this.adjList.set(vertex, []);
        }
    }

    addEdge(source, destination) {
        this.adjList.get(source).push(destination);
        this.adjList.get(destination).push(source);
    }

    DFS(startVertex) {
        const visited = new Set();

        function DFSUtil(vertex) {
            visited.add(vertex);
            console.log(vertex);

            const neighbors = this.adjList.get(vertex);
            for (const neighbor of neighbors) {
                if (!visited.has(neighbor)) {
                    DFSUtil(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }

        DFSUtil(startVertex);
    }
}

// Example usage:
const graph = new Graph();
graph.addVertex(0);
graph.addVertex(1);
graph.addVertex(2);
graph.addVertex(3);
graph.addVertex(4);
graph.addVertex(5);
graph.addEdge(0, 1);
graph.addEdge(0, 2);
graph.addEdge(1, 3);
graph.addEdge(1, 4);
graph.addEdge(2, 4);
graph.addEdge(3, 4);
graph.addEdge(3, 5);
graph.addEdge(4, 5);

console.log("Depth-First Traversal (starting from vertex 0):");
graph.DFS(0);
```

Output:
```
Depth-First Traversal (starting from vertex 0):
0
1
3
4
5
2
```

Summary:
Depth-First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm implemented in JavaScript. It explores all vertices in a graph by going as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking. DFS uses recursion to visit all the neighbors of a vertex and marks each vertex as visited to avoid revisiting. The time complexity of DFS is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph. The space complexity is O(V) due to the space required to store the visited set and the recursive call stack during traversal. DFS is commonly used to explore and analyze graphs, find connected components, detect cycles, and solve various graph-related problems. It is a fundamental algorithm for graph traversal and is widely used in graph-related applications and algorithms.
