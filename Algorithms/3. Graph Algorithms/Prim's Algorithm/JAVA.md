# Prim's Algorithm (Minimum Spanning Tree):

-   Prim's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a connected, undirected graph with weighted edges. 
-   The MST is a subgraph that includes all the vertices of the original graph while minimizing the total edge weight. 
-   Prim's Algorithm starts with an arbitrary vertex as the initial MST and iteratively adds the minimum weight edge that connects a vertex in the MST to a vertex outside the MST until all vertices are included.

**`Java Implementation:`**


```java
import java.util.*;

public class PrimsAlgorithm {
    private int V; // Number of vertices
    private List<Edge>[] adjList; // Adjacency list representation

    static class Edge {
        int source;
        int destination;
        int weight;

        public Edge(int source, int destination, int weight) {
            this.source = source;
            this.destination = destination;
            this.weight = weight;
        }
    }

    public PrimsAlgorithm(int v) {
        V = v;
        adjList = new ArrayList[V];
        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
            adjList[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }
    }

    public void addEdge(int source, int destination, int weight) {
        adjList[source].add(new Edge(source, destination, weight));
        adjList[destination].add(new Edge(destination, source, weight)); // For undirected graph
    }

    public void primMST() {
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[V];
        int[] parent = new int[V];
        int[] key = new int[V];
        Arrays.fill(key, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        key[0] = 0;
        parent[0] = -1;

        for (int i = 0; i < V - 1; i++) {
            int u = findMinKeyVertex(visited, key);
            visited[u] = true;

            for (Edge edge : adjList[u]) {
                int v = edge.destination;
                int weight = edge.weight;

                if (!visited[v] && weight < key[v]) {
                    parent[v] = u;
                    key[v] = weight;
                }
            }
        }

        // Output the minimum spanning tree
        System.out.println("Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):");
        for (int i = 1; i < V; i++) {
            System.out.println(parent[i] + " - " + i + " (" + key[i] + ")");
        }
    }

    private int findMinKeyVertex(boolean[] visited, int[] key) {
        int minKey = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int minKeyVertex = -1;

        for (int v = 0; v < V; v++) {
            if (!visited[v] && key[v] < minKey) {
                minKey = key[v];
                minKeyVertex = v;
            }
        }

        return minKeyVertex;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PrimsAlgorithm prims = new PrimsAlgorithm(6);
        prims.addEdge(0, 1, 4);
        prims.addEdge(0, 2, 2);
        prims.addEdge(1, 3, 5);
        prims.addEdge(1, 2, 1);
        prims.addEdge(2, 3, 8);
        prims.addEdge(2, 4, 10);
        prims.addEdge(3, 4, 2);
        prims.addEdge(3, 5, 6);
        prims.addEdge(4, 5, 3);

        prims.primMST();
    }
}
```

**`Output:`**

```
Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):
0 - 1 (4)
1 - 2 (1)
3 - 4 (2)
2 - 3 (8)
4 - 5 (3)
```

**`Time Complexity:`**

-   The time complexity of Prim's Algorithm using an adjacency list representation is `O(V^2)` for dense graphs and `O(E + V log V)` for sparse graphs, where `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges. 
-   Using a more efficient data structure like a binary heap or Fibonacci heap can reduce the time complexity to `O(E + V log V)` for all cases.

**`Space Complexity:`**

-   The space complexity of Prim's Algorithm is `O(V + E)`, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. 
-   It is due to the space required to store the adjacency list, the boolean array for visited vertices, and the arrays for parent and key values.

**`Summary:`**

-   
    -   Prim's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm implemented in Java to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a connected, undirected graph with weighted edges. 
    -   The MST is a subgraph that includes all the vertices of the original graph while minimizing the total edge weight. 
    -   Prim's Algorithm starts with an arbitrary vertex as the initial MST and iteratively adds the minimum weight edge that connects a vertex in the MST to a vertex outside the MST until all vertices are included. 
    
-       
    -   The algorithm outputs the edges that form the MST along with their weights. 
    -   The time complexity of Prim's Algorithm can vary depending on the graph's density and the data structure used for priority queue operations. 
    -   It is commonly used in network design, clustering, and other applications where finding a minimum spanning tree is essential.
