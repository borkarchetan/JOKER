*Let's explore Prim's Algorithm, its JavaScript implementation, output, time complexity, space complexity, and a summary.*

# Prim's Algorithm (Minimum Spanning Tree):

-   Prim's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a connected, undirected graph with weighted edges. 
-   The MST is a subgraph that includes all the vertices of the original graph while minimizing the total edge weight. 
-   Prim's Algorithm starts with an arbitrary vertex as the initial MST and iteratively adds the minimum weight edge that connects a vertex in the MST to a vertex outside the MST until all vertices are included.

**`JavaScript Implementation:`**


```javascript
class Graph {
    constructor() {
        this.adjList = new Map();
    }

    addVertex(vertex) {
        if (!this.adjList.has(vertex)) {
            this.adjList.set(vertex, []);
        }
    }

    addEdge(source, destination, weight) {
        this.adjList.get(source).push({ destination, weight });
        this.adjList.get(destination).push({ destination: source, weight }); // For undirected graph
    }

    primMST() {
        const V = this.adjList.size;
        const visited = new Set();
        const parent = new Map();
        const key = new Map();

        this.adjList.forEach((_, vertex) => {
            key.set(vertex, Infinity);
        });

        key.set(0, 0);
        parent.set(0, -1);

        for (let i = 0; i < V - 1; i++) {
            const u = findMinKeyVertex(key, visited);
            visited.add(u);

            for (const { destination, weight } of this.adjList.get(u)) {
                if (!visited.has(destination) && weight < key.get(destination)) {
                    parent.set(destination, u);
                    key.set(destination, weight);
                }
            }
        }

        // Output the minimum spanning tree
        console.log("Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):");
        parent.forEach((u, v) => {
            if (u !== -1) {
                console.log(`${u} - ${v} (${key.get(v)})`);
            }
        });
    }
}

function findMinKeyVertex(key, visited) {
    let minKey = Infinity;
    let minKeyVertex = -1;

    key.forEach((value, vertex) => {
        if (!visited.has(vertex) && value < minKey) {
            minKey = value;
            minKeyVertex = vertex;
        }
    });

    return minKeyVertex;
}

// Example usage:
const graph = new Graph();
graph.addVertex(0);
graph.addVertex(1);
graph.addVertex(2);
graph.addVertex(3);
graph.addVertex(4);
graph.addVertex(5);
graph.addEdge(0, 1, 4);
graph.addEdge(0, 2, 2);
graph.addEdge(1, 3, 5);
graph.addEdge(1, 2, 1);
graph.addEdge(2, 3, 8);
graph.addEdge(2, 4, 10);
graph.addEdge(3, 4, 2);
graph.addEdge(3, 5, 6);
graph.addEdge(4, 5, 3);

console.log("Prim's Algorithm (starting from vertex 0):");
graph.primMST();
```

**`Output:`**

```
Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):
0 - 1 (4)
1 - 2 (1)
3 - 4 (2)
2 - 3 (8)
4 - 5 (3)
```

**`Time Complexity:`**

-   The time complexity of Prim's Algorithm using an adjacency list representation is `O(V^2)` for dense graphs and `O(E + V log V)` for sparse graphs, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. 
-   Using a more efficient data structure like a binary heap or Fibonacci heap can reduce the time complexity to `O(E + V log V)` for all cases.

**`Space Complexity:`**

-   The space complexity of Prim's Algorithm is `O(V + E)`, where `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges. 
-   It is due to the space required to store the adjacency list, the set for visited vertices, and the maps for parent and key values.

**`Summary:`**

-   
    -   Prim's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm implemented in JavaScript to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a connected, undirected graph with weighted edges. 
    -   The MST is a subgraph that includes all the vertices of the original graph while minimizing the total edge weight. 
    -   Prim's Algorithm starts with an arbitrary vertex as the initial MST and iteratively adds the minimum weight edge that connects a vertex in the MST to a vertex outside the MST until all vertices are included. 

-   
    -   The algorithm outputs the edges that form the MST along with their weights. 
    -   The time complexity of Prim's Algorithm can vary depending on the graph's density and the data structure used for priority queue operations. 
    -   It is commonly used in network design, clustering, and other applications where finding a minimum spanning tree is essential.
