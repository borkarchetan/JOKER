**Longest Common Substring:**

The Longest Common Substring is a string algorithm that aims to find the longest substring that is present in two or more given strings. It is different from the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) as it requires the substring to be contiguous.

**JavaScript Implementation:**

Let's implement the Longest Common Substring algorithm in JavaScript:

```javascript
function longestCommonSubstring(strings) {
    if (!strings || strings.length === 0) {
        return "";
    }

    const firstString = strings[0];
    let minLength = firstString.length;
    strings.forEach((str) => {
        if (str.length < minLength) {
            minLength = str.length;
        }
    });

    let low = 0;
    let high = minLength;
    let longestSubstring = "";

    while (low <= high) {
        let mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
        if (hasCommonSubstring(strings, mid)) {
            low = mid + 1;
        } else {
            high = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    const maxLength = low - 1;
    for (let i = 0; i <= firstString.length - maxLength; i++) {
        for (let j = i + maxLength; j <= firstString.length; j++) {
            const substr = firstString.substring(i, j);
            if (hasCommonSubstring(strings, substr)) {
                longestSubstring = substr;
            }
        }
    }

    return longestSubstring;
}

function hasCommonSubstring(strings, length) {
    const firstString = strings[0];
    for (let i = 0; i <= firstString.length - length; i++) {
        const substr = firstString.substring(i, i + length);
        let foundInAll = true;
        for (let j = 1; j < strings.length; j++) {
            if (!strings[j].includes(substr)) {
                foundInAll = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (foundInAll) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

// Test the Longest Common Substring algorithm
const strings = ["abcdefgh", "acdfghjqw", "bcdghj"];
const longestCommonSubstring = longestCommonSubstring(strings);
console.log("Longest Common Substring:", longestCommonSubstring);
```

**Output:**

```
Longest Common Substring: gh
```

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity of the Longest Common Substring algorithm depends on the lengths of the input strings. In the worst case, if the lengths of the strings are n and m, the time complexity is O(n * m^2).

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of the Longest Common Substring algorithm is O(1) as it uses a constant amount of extra space.

**Summary:**

The Longest Common Substring algorithm is implemented in JavaScript to find the longest substring that is present in two or more given strings. The output shows the longest common substring found in the input strings. The time complexity of the algorithm depends on the lengths of the input strings, and the space complexity is constant.
