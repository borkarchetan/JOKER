*Let's explore the Radix Sort algorithm, its Java implementation, time complexity, space complexity, and a summary.*

# Radix Sort:

-   Radix Sort is a non-comparison based sorting algorithm that sorts integers by processing individual digits from the least significant digit to the most significant digit (or vice versa). 
-   It uses counting sort as a subroutine to sort the elements based on each digit's value.

`Java Implementation:`

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class RadixSort {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66};
        System.out.println("Original array: ");
        printArray(arr);

        radixSort(arr);

        System.out.println("Sorted array: ");
        printArray(arr);
    }

    public static void radixSort(int[] arr) {
        int max = Arrays.stream(arr).max().getAsInt();
        for (int exp = 1; max / exp > 0; exp *= 10) {
            countingSortByDigit(arr, exp);
        }
    }

    public static void countingSortByDigit(int[] arr, int exp) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int[] output = new int[n];
        int[] count = new int[10];

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            count[(arr[i] / exp) % 10]++;
        }

        for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
            count[i] += count[i - 1];
        }

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            output[count[(arr[i] / exp) % 10] - 1] = arr[i];
            count[(arr[i] / exp) % 10]--;
        }

        System.arraycopy(output, 0, arr, 0, n);
    }

    public static void printArray(int[] arr) {
        for (int value : arr) {
            System.out.print(value + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
}
```

**`Time Complexity:`**

-   The time complexity of Radix Sort is `O(d * (n + k))`, where n is the number of elements in the input array, d is the number of digits in the maximum element, and k is the range of input values (usually 10 for decimal integers). 
-   Since the number of digits (d) is typically a constant for integers, the time complexity simplifies to `O(n + k)`.

**`Space Complexity:`**

-   The space complexity of Radix Sort is `O(n + k)`, where n is the number of elements in the input array, and k is the range of input values. 
-   The algorithm uses extra memory to store the output array and the count array, both of which have sizes proportional to n and k.

**`Summary:`**

- 
    -   Radix Sort is a non-comparison based sorting algorithm implemented in Java. 
    -   It sorts integers by processing individual digits from the least significant digit to the most significant digit (or vice versa) using counting sort as a subroutine. 
    -   Its time complexity is `O(n + k)`, making it a linear-time sorting algorithm for integers. 
    -   Radix Sort is most efficient when the number of digits (d) is relatively small compared to the number of elements (n).

- 
    -   Radix Sort is particularly useful when sorting non-comparable elements, such as strings, where other comparison-based sorting algorithms may not be directly applicable. 
    -   However, Radix Sort is limited to sorting positive integers or numbers with a fixed maximum number of digits. 
    -   For negative integers or numbers with varying lengths, additional modifications to the algorithm are required.
