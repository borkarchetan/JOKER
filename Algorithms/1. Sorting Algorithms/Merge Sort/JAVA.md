*Let's explore the Merge Sort algorithm, its Java implementation, time complexity, space complexity, and a summary.*

# Merge Sort:

-   Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves to produce the final sorted array.

`Java Implementation:`

```java
public class MergeSort {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90};
        System.out.println("Original array: ");
        printArray(arr);

        mergeSort(arr, 0, arr.length - 1);

        System.out.println("Sorted array: ");
        printArray(arr);
    }

    public static void mergeSort(int[] arr, int left, int right) {
        if (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

            // Sort the left and right halves
            mergeSort(arr, left, mid);
            mergeSort(arr, mid + 1, right);

            // Merge the sorted halves
            merge(arr, left, mid, right);
        }
    }

    public static void merge(int[] arr, int left, int mid, int right) {
        int n1 = mid - left + 1;
        int n2 = right - mid;

        int[] leftArr = new int[n1];
        int[] rightArr = new int[n2];

        // Copy data to temporary arrays
        for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++) {
            leftArr[i] = arr[left + i];
        }
        for (int j = 0; j < n2; j++) {
            rightArr[j] = arr[mid + 1 + j];
        }

        // Merge the two temporary arrays
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        int k = left;

        while (i < n1 && j < n2) {
            if (leftArr[i] <= rightArr[j]) {
                arr[k] = leftArr[i];
                i++;
            } else {
                arr[k] = rightArr[j];
                j++;
            }
            k++;
        }

        // Copy remaining elements from leftArr and rightArr, if any
        while (i < n1) {
            arr[k] = leftArr[i];
            i++;
            k++;
        }

        while (j < n2) {
            arr[k] = rightArr[j];
            j++;
            k++;
        }
    }

    public static void printArray(int[] arr) {
        for (int value : arr) {
            System.out.print(value + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
}
```

**`Time Complexity:`**

-   The time complexity of Merge Sort is `O(n log n)` in all cases. 
-   The algorithm divides the input array into two halves at each level of recursion, and each half is sorted individually before merging. 
-   The merging step takes linear time `O(n)` at each level. 
-   Since the array is divided into log n levels, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`.

**`Space Complexity:`**

-   The space complexity of Merge Sort is `O(n)` in all cases. 
-   Merge Sort uses additional memory to store the temporary arrays during the merging process. 
-   The size of these temporary arrays is proportional to the input array's size, leading to a space complexity of `O(n)`.

**`Summary:`**

- 
    -   Merge Sort is an efficient *divide-and-conquer* sorting algorithm implemented in Java. 
    -   It divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves to produce the final sorted array. 
    -   Its time complexity is `O(n log n)` in all cases, making it one of the most efficient sorting algorithms for large datasets.
    -   Its space complexity is `O(n)` due to the temporary arrays used during merging.

- 
    -   Merge Sort is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning it preserves the relative order of equal elements. 
    -   It is widely used in practice due to its efficiency and stability, and it is often the algorithm of choice for sorting large collections of data.
