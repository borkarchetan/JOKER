Let's explore the Merge Sort algorithm, its JavaScript implementation, time complexity, space complexity, and a summary.

# Merge Sort:

-   Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves to produce the final sorted array.

`JavaScript Implementation:`

```javascript
function mergeSort(arr) {
    if (arr.length <= 1) {
        return arr;
    }

    const mid = Math.floor(arr.length / 2);
    const left = arr.slice(0, mid);
    const right = arr.slice(mid);

    return merge(mergeSort(left), mergeSort(right));
}

function merge(left, right) {
    let result = [];
    let leftIdx = 0;
    let rightIdx = 0;

    while (leftIdx < left.length && rightIdx < right.length) {
        if (left[leftIdx] < right[rightIdx]) {
            result.push(left[leftIdx]);
            leftIdx++;
        } else {
            result.push(right[rightIdx]);
            rightIdx++;
        }
    }

    return result.concat(left.slice(leftIdx)).concat(right.slice(rightIdx));
}

// Example usage:
const arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90];
console.log("Original array: " + arr.join(", "));
const sortedArr = mergeSort(arr);
console.log("Sorted array: " + sortedArr.join(", "));
```

**`Time Complexity:`**
 
-   The time complexity of Merge Sort is `O(n log n)` in all cases. 
-   The algorithm divides the input array into two halves at each level of recursion, and each half is sorted individually before merging. 
-   The merging step takes linear time `O(n)` at each level. 
-   Since the array is divided into log n levels, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`.

**`Space Complexity:`**

 
-   The space complexity of Merge Sort is `O(n)` in all cases. Merge Sort uses additional memory to store the temporary arrays during the merging process. - The size of these temporary arrays is proportional to the input array's size, leading to a space complexity of `O(n)`.

**`Summary:`**

- 
    -   Merge Sort is an efficient *divide-and-conquer* sorting algorithm implemented in JavaScript. 
    -   It divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves to produce the final sorted array. 
    -   Its time complexity is `O(n log n)` in all cases, making it one of the most efficient sorting algorithms for large datasets. 
    -   Its space complexity is `O(n)` due to the temporary arrays used during merging.
- 
    -   Merge Sort is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning it preserves the relative order of equal elements. 
    -   It is widely used in practice due to its efficiency and stability, and it is often the algorithm of choice for sorting large collections of data.
