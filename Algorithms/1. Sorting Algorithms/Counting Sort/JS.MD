Let's explore the Counting Sort algorithm, its JavaScript implementation, time complexity, space complexity, and a summary.

# Counting Sort:

- Counting Sort is an integer sorting algorithm that works by determining the number of occurrences of each distinct element in the input array and then using this information to reconstruct the sorted array.

`JavaScript Implementation:`

```javascript
function countingSort(arr) {
    if (arr.length === 0) {
        return arr;
    }

    // Find the maximum element to determine the range of counting array
    let max = arr[0];
    for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > max) {
            max = arr[i];
        }
    }

    const countArray = new Array(max + 1).fill(0);
    const sortedArray = new Array(arr.length);

    // Count the occurrences of each element in the input array
    for (let num of arr) {
        countArray[num]++;
    }

    // Modify the count array to store the positions of elements in the sorted order
    for (let i = 1; i < countArray.length; i++) {
        countArray[i] += countArray[i - 1];
    }

    // Build the sorted array
    for (let i = arr.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        sortedArray[countArray[arr[i]] - 1] = arr[i];
        countArray[arr[i]]--;
    }

    return sortedArray;
}

// Example usage:
const arr = [4, 2, 2, 8, 3, 3, 1];
console.log("Original array: " + arr.join(", "));
const sortedArr = countingSort(arr);
console.log("Sorted array: " + sortedArr.join(", "));
```

**`Time Complexity:`**

- The time complexity of Counting Sort is `O(n + k)`, where n is the number of elements in the input array, and k is the range of input values. 
- It is a linear-time sorting algorithm and performs exceptionally well when the range of input values (k) is relatively small compared to the number of elements (n).

**`Space Complexity:`**

- The space complexity of Counting Sort is `O(n + k)`, where n is the number of elements in the input array, and k is the range of input values. 
- The algorithm uses extra memory to store the count array and the sorted array, both of which have sizes proportional to n and k.

**`Summary:`**

- 
    - Counting Sort is a non-comparison based sorting algorithm implemented in JavaScript. 
    - It works well when the range of input values is small compared to the number of elements, making it particularly efficient for integer sorting tasks. 
    - Its time complexity is `O(n + k)`, and its space complexity is `O(n + k)`. 
    - Counting Sort is most effective when the range of input values is not significantly larger than the number of elements to be sorted.

- 
    - However, Counting Sort is not suitable for sorting elements with a large range or floating-point numbers. 
    - It requires additional memory proportional to the range of input values, which can be impractical for large ranges. 
    - For such cases, other sorting algorithms like Merge Sort, Quick Sort, or Heap Sort might be more appropriate.
