# Coin Change Problem: 

-   The Coin Change Problem is a classic dynamic programming problem that involves finding the minimum number of coins needed to make a certain amount of change. 
-   Given a set of coin denominations and a target amount, the goal is to determine the minimum number of coins required to make the target amount using the given denominations.

-   For example, if we have coins with denominations [1, 5, 10] and the target amount is 14, the minimum number of coins needed would be 2 (10 + 4).

**`JavaScript Implementation:`**

Let's implement the Coin Change Problem in JavaScript using dynamic programming:

```javascript
function coinChange(coins, amount) {
    const dp = Array(amount + 1).fill(amount + 1);
    dp[0] = 0;

    for (const coin of coins) {
        for (let i = coin; i <= amount; i++) {
            dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
        }
    }

    return dp[amount] > amount ? -1 : dp[amount];
}

// Test the Coin Change Problem
const coins = [1, 5, 10];
const amount = 14;

const minCoins = coinChange(coins, amount);
console.log("Minimum number of coins needed:", minCoins);
```

**`Output:`**
```
Minimum number of coins needed: 2
```

**`Time Complexity:`**

-   The time complexity of the dynamic programming approach for the Coin Change Problem is `O(n * m)`, where n is the amount and m is the number of coin denominations. 
-   This is because we need to fill up the dp array of size (amount + 1) for each coin denomination.

**`Space Complexity:`**

-   The space complexity of the dynamic programming approach is `O(n)`, where n is the amount. 
-   We use a 1D dp array of size [(amount + 1)] to store the minimum number of coins needed for each amount.

**`Summary:`**

-   The Coin Change Problem is efficiently solved using dynamic programming in JavaScript. 
-   The implementation uses a 1D dp array to find the minimum number of coins needed to make a target amount using the given denominations. 
-   The algorithm has a time complexity of `O(n * m)` and a space complexity of `O(n)`. 
-   The Coin Change Problem has various applications, including making change in vending machines, cashier systems, and financial transactions.
