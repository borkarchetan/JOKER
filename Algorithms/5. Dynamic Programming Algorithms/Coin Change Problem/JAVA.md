# Coin Change Problem:

-   The Coin Change Problem is a classic dynamic programming problem that involves finding the minimum number of coins needed to make a certain amount of change. 
-   Given a set of coin denominations and a target amount, the goal is to determine the minimum number of coins required to make the target amount using the given denominations.

-   For example, if we have coins with denominations [1, 5, 10] and the target amount is 14, the minimum number of coins needed would be 2 (10 + 4).

**`Java Implementation:`**

Let's implement the Coin Change Problem in Java using dynamic programming:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class CoinChange {

    public static int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
        int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
        Arrays.fill(dp, amount + 1);
        dp[0] = 0;

        for (int coin : coins) {
            for (int i = coin; i <= amount; i++) {
                dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
            }
        }

        return dp[amount] > amount ? -1 : dp[amount];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] coins = {1, 5, 10};
        int amount = 14;

        int minCoins = coinChange(coins, amount);
        System.out.println("Minimum number of coins needed: " + minCoins);
    }
}
```

**`Output:`**
```
Minimum number of coins needed: 2
```

**`Time Complexity:`**

-   The time complexity of the dynamic programming approach for the Coin Change Problem is `O(n * m)`, where n is the amount and m is the number of coin denominations. 
-   This is because we need to fill up the dp array of size (amount + 1) for each coin denomination.

**`Space Complexity:`**

-   The space complexity of the dynamic programming approach is `O(n)`, where n is the amount. 
-   We use a 1D dp array of size [(amount + 1)] to store the minimum number of coins needed for each amount.

**`Summary:`**

-   The Coin Change Problem is efficiently solved using dynamic programming in Java. 
-   The implementation uses a 1D dp array to find the minimum number of coins needed to make a target amount using the given denominations. 
-   The algorithm has a time complexity of `O(n * m)` and a space complexity of `O(n)`. 
-   The Coin Change Problem has various applications, including making change in vending machines, cashier systems, and financial transactions.
