**Longest Common Subsequence (LCS):**

The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) is a dynamic programming problem that seeks to find the longest subsequence that is common to two given strings. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous, in both strings.

For example, given two strings "ABCDGH" and "AEDFHR", the LCS is "ADH" with a length of 3.

**Java Implementation:**

Let's implement the Longest Common Subsequence problem in Java using dynamic programming:

```java
public class LongestCommonSubsequence {

    public static String findLCS(String str1, String str2) {
        int m = str1.length();
        int n = str2.length();

        int[][] dp = new int[m + 1][n + 1];

        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                if (str1.charAt(i - 1) == str2.charAt(j - 1)) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
                }
            }
        }

        // Reconstruct the LCS
        StringBuilder lcs = new StringBuilder();
        int i = m, j = n;
        while (i > 0 && j > 0) {
            if (str1.charAt(i - 1) == str2.charAt(j - 1)) {
                lcs.insert(0, str1.charAt(i - 1));
                i--;
                j--;
            } else if (dp[i - 1][j] > dp[i][j - 1]) {
                i--;
            } else {
                j--;
            }
        }

        return lcs.toString();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str1 = "ABCDGH";
        String str2 = "AEDFHR";

        String lcs = findLCS(str1, str2);
        System.out.println("Longest Common Subsequence: " + lcs);
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Longest Common Subsequence: ADH
```

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity of the dynamic programming approach for finding the LCS of two strings of lengths m and n is O(m * n). This is because we need to fill up the dp array of size (m+1) x (n+1).

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of the dynamic programming approach is O(m * n) because of the dp array used for memoization.

**Summary:**

The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem is efficiently solved using dynamic programming. In the Java implementation, we construct a 2D dp array to find the LCS of two given strings. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(m * n) and a space complexity of O(m * n). The LCS problem is useful in various applications, including text comparison, bioinformatics, and data comparison.
