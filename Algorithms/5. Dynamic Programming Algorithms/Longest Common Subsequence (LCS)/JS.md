**Longest Common Subsequence (LCS):**

The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) is a dynamic programming problem that seeks to find the longest subsequence that is common to two given strings. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous, in both strings.

For example, given two strings "ABCDGH" and "AEDFHR", the LCS is "ADH" with a length of 3.

**JavaScript Implementation:**

Let's implement the Longest Common Subsequence problem in JavaScript using dynamic programming:

```javascript
function findLCS(str1, str2) {
    const m = str1.length;
    const n = str2.length;

    const dp = Array.from({ length: m + 1 }, () => Array(n + 1).fill(0));

    for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            if (str1[i - 1] === str2[j - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
    }

    // Reconstruct the LCS
    let i = m, j = n;
    const lcs = [];
    while (i > 0 && j > 0) {
        if (str1[i - 1] === str2[j - 1]) {
            lcs.unshift(str1[i - 1]);
            i--;
            j--;
        } else if (dp[i - 1][j] > dp[i][j - 1]) {
            i--;
        } else {
            j--;
        }
    }

    return lcs.join('');
}

// Test the Longest Common Subsequence
const str1 = "ABCDGH";
const str2 = "AEDFHR";

const lcs = findLCS(str1, str2);
console.log("Longest Common Subsequence:", lcs);
```

**Output:**
```
Longest Common Subsequence: ADH
```

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity of the dynamic programming approach for finding the LCS of two strings of lengths m and n is O(m * n). This is because we need to fill up the dp array of size (m+1) x (n+1).

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of the dynamic programming approach is O(m * n) because of the dp array used for memoization.

**Summary:**

The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem is efficiently solved using dynamic programming in JavaScript. The implementation constructs a 2D dp array to find the LCS of two given strings. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(m * n) and a space complexity of O(m * n). The LCS problem is useful in various applications, including text comparison, bioinformatics, and data comparison.
