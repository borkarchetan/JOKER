**Edit Distance:**

The Edit Distance, also known as Levenshtein Distance, is a dynamic programming problem that measures the similarity between two strings. It calculates the minimum number of single-character insertions, deletions, or substitutions required to convert one string into another.

For example, the edit distance between "kitten" and "sitting" is 3, as the following transformations are needed: "kitten" -> "sitten" -> "sittin" -> "sitting".

**JavaScript Implementation:**

Let's implement the Edit Distance problem in JavaScript using dynamic programming:

```javascript
function minDistance(word1, word2) {
    const m = word1.length;
    const n = word2.length;
    const dp = Array.from({ length: m + 1 }, () => Array(n + 1).fill(0));

    for (let i = 0; i <= m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j <= n; j++) {
            if (i === 0) {
                dp[i][j] = j;
            } else if (j === 0) {
                dp[i][j] = i;
            } else if (word1[i - 1] === word2[j - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = 1 + Math.min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j - 1]);
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[m][n];
}

// Test the Edit Distance problem
const word1 = "kitten";
const word2 = "sitting";

const distance = minDistance(word1, word2);
console.log("Edit Distance:", distance);
```

**Output:**
```
Edit Distance: 3
```

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity of the dynamic programming approach for the Edit Distance problem is O(m * n), where m and n are the lengths of the two input strings. This is because we need to fill up the 2D dp array of size (m+1) x (n+1).

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of the dynamic programming approach is O(m * n) because of the dp array used for memoization.

**Summary:**

The Edit Distance problem is efficiently solved using dynamic programming in JavaScript. The implementation constructs a 2D dp array to find the minimum number of single-character insertions, deletions, or substitutions required to convert one string into another. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(m * n) and a space complexity of O(m * n). The Edit Distance problem has various applications in spell checking, DNA sequence analysis, and computational biology.
