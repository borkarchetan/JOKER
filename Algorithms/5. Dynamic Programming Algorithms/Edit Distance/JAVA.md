**Edit Distance:**

The Edit Distance, also known as Levenshtein Distance, is a dynamic programming problem that measures the similarity between two strings. It calculates the minimum number of single-character insertions, deletions, or substitutions required to convert one string into another.

For example, the edit distance between "kitten" and "sitting" is 3, as the following transformations are needed: "kitten" -> "sitten" -> "sittin" -> "sitting".

**Java Implementation:**

Let's implement the Edit Distance problem in Java using dynamic programming:

```java
public class EditDistance {

    public static int minDistance(String word1, String word2) {
        int m = word1.length();
        int n = word2.length();
        int[][] dp = new int[m + 1][n + 1];

        for (int i = 0; i <= m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++) {
                if (i == 0) {
                    dp[i][j] = j;
                } else if (j == 0) {
                    dp[i][j] = i;
                } else if (word1.charAt(i - 1) == word2.charAt(j - 1)) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + Math.min(Math.min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]), dp[i - 1][j - 1]);
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[m][n];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String word1 = "kitten";
        String word2 = "sitting";

        int distance = minDistance(word1, word2);
        System.out.println("Edit Distance: " + distance);
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Edit Distance: 3
```

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity of the dynamic programming approach for the Edit Distance problem is O(m * n), where m and n are the lengths of the two input strings. This is because we need to fill up the 2D dp array of size (m+1) x (n+1).

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of the dynamic programming approach is O(m * n) because of the dp array used for memoization.

**Summary:**

The Edit Distance problem is efficiently solved using dynamic programming in Java. The implementation constructs a 2D dp array to find the minimum number of single-character insertions, deletions, or substitutions required to convert one string into another. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(m * n) and a space complexity of O(m * n). The Edit Distance problem has various applications in spell checking, DNA sequence analysis, and computational biology.
