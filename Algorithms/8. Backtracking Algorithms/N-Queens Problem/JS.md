**N-Queens Problem:**

The N-Queens Problem is a classic backtracking problem that involves placing N queens on an N×N chessboard in such a way that no two queens attack each other. In chess, a queen can attack any piece in its horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines of movement. The goal is to find all possible distinct arrangements of N queens on the board.

**JavaScript Implementation:**

Let's implement the N-Queens Problem in JavaScript using backtracking:

```javascript
function solveNQueens(n) {
    const result = [];
    const board = new Array(n).fill(null).map(() => new Array(n).fill('.'));

    function backtrack(row) {
        if (row === n) {
            const solution = board.map(row => row.join(''));
            result.push(solution);
            return;
        }

        for (let col = 0; col < n; col++) {
            if (isValid(row, col)) {
                board[row][col] = 'Q';
                backtrack(row + 1);
                board[row][col] = '.';
            }
        }
    }

    function isValid(row, col) {
        for (let i = 0; i < row; i++) {
            if (board[i][col] === 'Q') {
                return false;
            }
            const leftDiagonal = col - (row - i);
            const rightDiagonal = col + (row - i);
            if (leftDiagonal >= 0 && board[i][leftDiagonal] === 'Q') {
                return false;
            }
            if (rightDiagonal < n && board[i][rightDiagonal] === 'Q') {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    backtrack(0);
    return result;
}

// Test the N-Queens Problem
const n = 4;
const solutions = solveNQueens(n);
for (const solution of solutions) {
    for (const row of solution) {
        console.log(row);
    }
    console.log();
}
```

**Output:**
```
.Q..
...Q
Q...
..Q.

..Q.
Q...
...Q
.Q..
```

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity of the N-Queens Problem can be challenging to analyze precisely, as it depends on the number of valid solutions and the board size. However, in the worst case, the backtracking algorithm can explore all possible configurations, resulting in a time complexity of O(N!), where N is the board size.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of the N-Queens Problem is O(N^2) because we need to create an N×N chessboard and store each solution.

**Summary:**

The N-Queens Problem is solved using backtracking in JavaScript. The implementation finds all possible distinct arrangements of N queens on an N×N chessboard, ensuring that no two queens attack each other. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(N!) and a space complexity of O(N^2). The N-Queens Problem is a classic example of a backtracking problem and has various applications in solving combinatorial optimization problems.
