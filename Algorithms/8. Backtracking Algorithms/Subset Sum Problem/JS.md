**Subset Sum Problem:**

The Subset Sum Problem is a classic backtracking problem in computer science, where the goal is to find whether there exists a subset of a given set whose sum is equal to a given target sum.

**JavaScript Implementation:**

Let's implement the Subset Sum Problem in JavaScript using backtracking:

```javascript
function subsetSum(nums, target) {
    const subset = [];
    const result = [];

    function subsetSumHelper(start, currentSum) {
        if (currentSum === target) {
            result.push([...subset]);
            return;
        }

        for (let i = start; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (currentSum + nums[i] <= target) {
                subset.push(nums[i]);
                subsetSumHelper(i + 1, currentSum + nums[i]);
                subset.pop();
            }
        }
    }

    subsetSumHelper(0, 0);
    return result;
}

// Test the Subset Sum algorithm
const nums = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];
const target = 14;

const subsets = subsetSum(nums, target);

if (subsets.length > 0) {
    console.log(`Subsets with sum ${target} found:`);
    subsets.forEach((subset) => {
        console.log(subset.join(', '));
    });
} else {
    console.log(`No subsets with sum ${target} found.`);
}
```

**Output:**

```
Subsets with sum 14 found:
2, 4, 8
6, 8
```

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity of the Subset Sum algorithm using backtracking can be high since it explores all possible subsets of the input set. In the worst case, the time complexity can be O(2^n), where n is the number of elements in the input set.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of the Subset Sum algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input set. It is due to the space required to store the subset and the result.

**Summary:**

The Subset Sum algorithm is implemented using backtracking in JavaScript. The algorithm finds whether there exists a subset of a given set whose sum is equal to the target sum. The output shows the subsets with the desired sum if any exist. The time complexity of the algorithm can be high, especially for large sets, but it is suitable for relatively small sets.
