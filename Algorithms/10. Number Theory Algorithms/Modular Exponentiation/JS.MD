**Modular Exponentiation:**

Modular exponentiation is an important algorithm used to compute large power values modulo a given number. It efficiently calculates (base^exponent) % modulus without causing integer overflow for large values.

**JavaScript Implementation:**

Let's implement modular exponentiation in JavaScript using an iterative approach:

```javascript
function modularExponentiation(base, exponent, modulus) {
    if (modulus === 1) {
        return 0;
    }

    let result = 1;
    base = base % modulus;

    while (exponent > 0) {
        if (exponent % 2 === 1) {
            result = (result * base) % modulus;
        }
        exponent = Math.floor(exponent / 2);
        base = (base * base) % modulus;
    }

    return result;
}

const base = 2;
const exponent = 10;
const modulus = 1000000007;

const result = modularExponentiation(base, exponent, modulus);
console.log(`${base} raised to the power ${exponent} modulo ${modulus} is: ${result}`);
```

**Output:**

```
2 raised to the power 10 modulo 1000000007 is: 1024
```

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity of the modular exponentiation algorithm is O(log(exponent)), where "exponent" is the power to which the base is raised. The algorithm uses a binary exponentiation technique, which reduces the number of multiplications required.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of the modular exponentiation algorithm is O(1) as it uses a constant amount of extra space to store intermediate results.

**Summary:**

Modular exponentiation is implemented in JavaScript using an iterative approach. The output shows the result of (base^exponent) % modulus. The algorithm efficiently calculates large power values modulo a given number. The time complexity is O(log(exponent)), and the space complexity is constant. This algorithm is often used in cryptographic applications and number theory problems.
