**Modular Exponentiation:**

Modular exponentiation is an important algorithm used to compute large power values modulo a given number. It efficiently calculates (base^exponent) % modulus without causing integer overflow for large values.

**Java Implementation:**

Let's implement modular exponentiation in Java using a recursive approach:

```java
public class ModularExponentiation {

    public static long modularExponentiation(long base, long exponent, long modulus) {
        if (modulus == 1) {
            return 0;
        }

        long result = 1;
        base = base % modulus;

        while (exponent > 0) {
            if (exponent % 2 == 1) {
                result = (result * base) % modulus;
            }
            exponent = exponent >> 1;
            base = (base * base) % modulus;
        }

        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        long base = 2;
        long exponent = 10;
        long modulus = 1000000007;

        long result = modularExponentiation(base, exponent, modulus);
        System.out.println(base + " raised to the power " + exponent + " modulo " + modulus + " is: " + result);
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
2 raised to the power 10 modulo 1000000007 is: 1024
```

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity of the modular exponentiation algorithm is O(log(exponent)), where "exponent" is the power to which the base is raised. The algorithm uses a binary exponentiation technique, which reduces the number of multiplications required.

**Space Complexity:**

The space complexity of the modular exponentiation algorithm is O(1) as it uses a constant amount of extra space to store intermediate results.

**Summary:**

Modular exponentiation is implemented in Java using a recursive approach. The output shows the result of (base^exponent) % modulus. The algorithm efficiently calculates large power values modulo a given number. The time complexity is O(log(exponent)), and the space complexity is constant. This algorithm is often used in cryptographic applications and number theory problems.
