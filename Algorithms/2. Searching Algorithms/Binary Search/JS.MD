# Binary Search


-   Binary Search is an efficient search algorithm used to find a target element in a sorted array. 


-   It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half and comparing the target element with the middle element of the array. 


-   If the middle element matches the target, the search is successful. 


-   Otherwise, the search continues in the left or right half of the array, depending on whether the target is smaller or larger than the middle element.

**`JavaScript Implementation:`**

```javascript
function binarySearch(arr, target) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = arr.length - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);

        if (arr[mid] === target) {
            return mid;
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    return -1;
}

// Example usage:
const arr = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35];
const target = 25;
const index = binarySearch(arr, target);
if (index !== -1) {
    console.log(`Element ${target} found at index ${index}`);
} else {
    console.log(`Element ${target} not found in the array.`);
}
```

**`Output:`**
```
Element 25 found at index 4
```

**`Time Complexity:`**


-   The time complexity of Binary Search is `O(log n)`, where n is the number of elements in the sorted array. 


-   In each iteration, the search interval is halved, leading to a significant reduction in the number of elements to be searched. 


-   This makes binary search highly efficient for large sorted arrays.


**`Space Complexity:`**


-   The space complexity of Binary Search is `O(1)`, which means the algorithm uses constant space regardless of the size of the input array. 


-   It does not require any additional memory that scales with the input size.



**`Summary:`**


-   Binary Search is an efficient search algorithm implemented in JavaScript. 


-   It is used to find a target element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. 


-   Its time complexity is `O(log n)`, which makes it highly efficient for large sorted arrays. 


-   Binary Search is particularly useful for searching tasks when the data is sorted, as it can quickly determine whether the target element is present or not. 


-   However, it requires the input array to be sorted beforehand, and if the array is frequently changing, Binary Search may not be the most suitable choice. 


-   Overall, Binary Search is a powerful and widely used algorithm for searching sorted data efficiently.
