**1. What is a thread in Java, and how does it differ from a process?**
- **Answer:** A thread in Java is the smallest unit of execution within a program. It represents a sequence of instructions that can run independently alongside other threads within the same process. Threads within a process share the same memory space and resources, allowing them to communicate and coordinate efficiently. A process, on the other hand, is an independent execution environment that contains its own memory space and resources. A process can have multiple threads, and threads within the same process share resources, while processes are isolated from each other.

**2. How can you create a thread by extending the `Thread` class and by implementing the `Runnable` interface?**
- **Answer:** You can create a thread by:
     - Extending the `Thread` class and overriding the `run()` method.
     - Implementing the `Runnable` interface and passing the instance to a `Thread` object. Implementing `Runnable` is preferred as it promotes better separation of concerns.
     - Example using `Runnable`:
   ```java
   class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
       public void run() {
           // Thread's work here
       }
   }
   Thread thread = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
   thread.start();
   ```

**3. Explain the concept of thread synchronization and why it's necessary.**
   - **Answer:** Thread synchronization is the process of coordinating the execution of multiple threads to ensure correct and orderly access to shared resources. It's necessary because concurrent access to shared resources can lead to data inconsistencies and race conditions. Synchronization mechanisms like `synchronized` blocks and methods, as well as locks, prevent multiple threads from interfering with each other, ensuring predictable and consistent behavior.

**4. What is the purpose of the `wait()` and `notify()` methods in Java concurrency?**
   - **Answer:** The `wait()` method is used to make a thread give up its monitor and wait until another thread notifies it. It's often used to implement thread synchronization and inter-thread communication. The `notify()` method wakes up one waiting thread that's waiting on the same object's monitor. Together with `notifyAll()`, they help coordinate threads to avoid issues like busy waiting and deadlocks.

**5. Describe how deadlock can occur in multithreading and ways to prevent it.**
- **Answer:** Deadlock occurs when two or more threads are unable to proceed because each is waiting for a resource held by another. To prevent deadlock, you can:
     - Use a consistent order for acquiring multiple locks to avoid circular waiting.
     - Use a timeout when acquiring locks and release them if the timeout is reached.
     - Implement resource allocation hierarchies to ensure a clear order of acquisition.
     - Utilize higher-level concurrency utilities provided by Java's `java.util.concurrent` package.

**6. What is a thread, and how does it relate to processes?**
   - **Answer:** A thread in Java is the smallest unit of execution that represents a sequence of instructions within a process. Threads share the same memory space and resources within a process, allowing them to concurrently execute tasks. In contrast, a process is an independent execution environment with its own memory space and resources. Multiple threads within the same process can communicate and coordinate, while processes are isolated from each other.

**7. How do you create and start a thread in Java?**
   - **Answer:** You can create and start a thread by either:
     - Extending the `Thread` class and overriding the `run()` method in the subclass.
     - Implementing the `Runnable` interface and passing an instance to a `Thread` object's constructor.
   Example using `Runnable`:
   ```java
   class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
       public void run() {
           // Thread's work here
       }
   }
   Thread thread = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
   thread.start();
   ```

**8. Explain the concept of thread synchronization. Why is it important?**
   - **Answer:** Thread synchronization involves coordinating the execution of multiple threads to ensure correct access to shared resources. It's important because concurrent access to shared resources can lead to data corruption and race conditions. Synchronization mechanisms like `synchronized` blocks/methods and locks prevent multiple threads from interfering with each other, ensuring data integrity and predictable behavior.

**9. What is the purpose of the `wait()` and `notify()` methods in Java concurrency?**
   - **Answer:** The `wait()` method suspends a thread's execution and releases the associated monitor, allowing other threads to acquire it. The `notify()` method wakes up one waiting thread that's waiting on the same object's monitor. These methods are used for inter-thread communication and synchronization, allowing threads to coordinate and communicate in a controlled manner.
