Certainly, here are the answers to the questions:

**1. What are Java access modifiers, and how do they control the visibility of class members?**
**Answer:** Access modifiers in Java are keywords that determine the level of access or visibility that class members (fields, methods, classes) have within and outside the class. There are four main access modifiers:

- `public`: Members are accessible from any class.
- `protected`: Members are accessible within the same package and subclasses.
- `default` (no modifier): Members are accessible within the same package only.
- `private`: Members are accessible only within the same class.

**2. Explain the differences between the "==" operator and the `equals()` method for comparing objects.**
**Answer:** The "==" operator compares object references to check if they refer to the same memory location, essentially checking if the objects are the same instance in memory. The `equals()` method, on the other hand, is used to compare the content or state of objects. It's often overridden in classes to define custom equality. For example, `String` class overrides `equals()` to compare character sequences.

**3. How can you convert a string representation of a number into an actual numeric data type?**
**Answer:**You can use the wrapper classes' parse methods:

- `Integer.parseInt(String)`: Converts to an `int`.
- `Double.parseDouble(String)`: Converts to a `double`.
- `Float.parseFloat(String)`: Converts to a `float`.
- `Long.parseLong(String)`: Converts to a `long`.

**4. What is the purpose of the "static" keyword when applied to a method or variable?**
**Answer:** When the "static" keyword is applied to a method or variable, it makes it belong to the class itself rather than to instances of the class. Static methods or variables can be accessed using the class name, without creating an instance of the class. They are shared across all instances of the class.

**5. Describe the difference between a local variable and an instance variable.**
**Answer:** A local variable is declared within a method, constructor, or block and has a limited scope. It exists only within that scope and cannot be accessed from outside. An instance variable is declared within a class but outside any method. It's associated with an instance of the class and exists as long as the instance does. Instance variables can be accessed across methods within the instance.

If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

Certainly, here are the answers to your questions:

**1. What are Java keywords? Give examples.**
**Answer:** Java keywords are reserved words that have predefined meanings in the Java programming language and cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, method names, etc.). Examples of Java keywords include `public`, `class`, `static`, `if`, `else`, `while`, `int`, `float`, and `return`.

**2. Explain the differences between primitive data types and reference types.**
**Answer:** Primitive data types are the basic building blocks for data manipulation and represent single values. They have a fixed size in memory and are not objects. Examples include `int`, `char`, `boolean`, and `double`. Reference types, on the other hand, are used to store references to objects in memory. They include classes, interfaces, arrays, and enums. Reference types allow for more complex data structures and behavior.

**3. How do you declare and initialize variables in Java?**
**Answer:** Variables are declared with a data type, followed by the variable name. Initialization can be done at the time of declaration or later using the assignment operator `=`. For example:

```java
int age; // Declaration
age = 25; // Initialization

double pi = 3.14159; // Declaration and initialization
```

**4. Describe type casting in Java. What's the difference between implicit and explicit casting?**
**Answer:** Type casting involves converting a value of one data type to another. Implicit casting, also known as widening or automatic type promotion, occurs when converting a smaller data type to a larger one without loss of data. For example, converting an `int` to a `double`. Explicit casting, also known as narrowing, requires the programmer to specify the conversion and may result in data loss. For example, converting a `double` to an `int`.

**5. Explain the concept of autoboxing and unboxing.**
**Answer:** Autoboxing is the automatic conversion of a primitive data type to its corresponding wrapper class object (e.g., `int` to `Integer`). Unboxing is the opposite process, where the wrapper class object is automatically converted back to a primitive data type. This feature was introduced in Java to simplify code when working with collections and methods that expect objects, but can accept primitive values.
